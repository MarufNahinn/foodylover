Chaat or chat (ISO: cāṭ; Hindi: चाट; Urdu: چاٹ; Punjabi: ਚਾਟ;Odia: ଚାଟ୍; Bengali: চাট) is a savoury snack that originated in India, typically served as an hors d'oeuvre at roadside tracks from stalls or food carts across the Indian subcontinent in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh."><img src="india/chaat.png" style="width:150px; height: 150px" ></a> 
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a href="india/2.png" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Rasgola -
Rasgulla or Rosogolla (Bengali: রসগোল্লা) is an Indian syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings"><img src="india/2.png" style="width:150px; height: 150px" ></a> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a href="india/dosa.png" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Masala Dosa - 
Masala dosa or masale dose or masaldosa is a variation of the popular South Indian dosa, which has its origins in Tuluva Mangalorean cuisine of Tulunadu. It is made from rice, lentils, potato, methi, and curry leaves, and served with chutneys and sambar."> <img src="india/dosa.png" style="width:150px; height: 150px" ></a> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a href="india/biryani.png" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Biryani - 
Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of India. It can be compared to mixing a curry, later combining it with semi-cooked rice separately. This dish is especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora."> <img src="india/biryani.png" style="width:150px; height: 150px" ></a> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a href="india/5.jpg" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Chole Bhatura - 
Chole bhature is a food dish originating from northern India. However, in Pakistan, Rawalpindi Chole Bhature is very popular, it is a combination of chana masala and bhatura/Puri, a fried bread made from maida. There is a distinct Punjabi variant of the dish."> <img src="india/5.jpg" style="width:150px; height: 150px" ></a> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a href="india/palak.png" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Paalak Paneer - 
Palak paneer is a vegetarian dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, consisting of paneer in a thick paste made from puréed spinach and spiced with ginger, garlic, tomatoes, garam masala, turmeric, chili powder and cumin"> <img src="india/palak.png" style="width:150px; height: 150px" ></a> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a href="india/somusa.png" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Samosa - 
A samosa is a fried or baked pastry with a savoury filling, such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, cheese, beef and other meats, or lentils. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region."> <img src="india/somusa.png" style="width:150px; height: 150px" ></a> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a href="india/8.png" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Stuffed Paratha - 
Parathas are one of the most popular unleavened flatbreads in the Indian Subcontinent, made by baking or cooking whole wheat dough on a tava, and finishing off with shallow frying.[9] Parathas are thicker and more substantial than chapatis/rotis and this is either because, in the case of a plain paratha, they have been layered by coating with ghee or oil and folding repeatedly (much like the method used for puff pastry or some types of Turkish börek) using a laminated dough technique; or else because food ingredients such as mixed vegetables have been mixed in with the dough, such as potato or cauliflower, green beans, and carrots."> <img src="india/8.png" style="width:150px; height: 150px" ></a> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a href="india/9.png" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Dam Alu - 
Dum Aloo or Aloor Dum is a potato based dish, it is a part of the traditional Kashmiri Pandit cuisine, from the Kashmir Valley, in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The potatoes, usually smaller ones, are first deep fried, then cooked slowly at low flame in a gravy with spices."> <img src="india/9.png" style="width:150px; height: 150px" ></a> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <a href="india/10.png" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Thali - 
Thali refers to the metal plate that a thali meal may be served on. Thali is popular in Punjab , Uttar Pradesh and other states in North India. The idea behind a thali is to offer all the 6 different flavours of sweet, salt, bitter, sour, astringent and spicy on one single plate (technically the last two are actually forms of chemesthesis rather than true flavours). According to Indian food custom, a proper meal should be a perfect balance of all these six flavours"><img src="india/10.png" style="width:150px; height: 150px" ></a>

  <br>
<p style="font-size:20px; text-align: center;">Here i represent you the origin of some famouse food around the world.Most of the food we eat comes from NATURE.<br>We can get food from animals, vegetables, fruits or the plants that the land provides us with, as well as minerals.

  <div style="width:870px; height: 350px ">  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
    <p style="font-size:23px; margin-left:25px; text-align: justify;" >The exact origin of the dish is uncertain. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed in the Muslim centers of Delhi (Mughlai cuisine), Lucknow (Awadhi cuisine) and other small principalities. In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad Deccan (where some believe the dish originated) as well as Tamil Nadu (Ambur, Thanjavur, Chettinad, Salem, Dindigal), Kerala (Malabar), Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka, where Muslim communities were present.</p>

  <div style="width:870px; height: 350px ">  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
    <p style="font-size:23px; margin-left:25px; text-align: justify;" >Fermented grain, fruit juice and honey have been used to make alcohol (ethyl alcohol or ethanol) for thousands of years. Fermented beverages existed in early Egyptian civilization, and there is evidence of an early alcoholic drink in China around 7000 B.C. In India, an alcoholic beverage called sura, distilled from rice, was in use between 3000 and 2000 B.C. The Babylonians worshiped a wine goddess as early as 2700 B.C. In Greece, one of the first alcoholic beverages to gain popularity was mead, a fermented drink made from honey and water. Greek literature is full of warnings against excessive drinking. Several Native American civilizations developed alcoholic beverages in pre-Columbian1 times.</p>

  <div style="width:870px; height: 350px ">  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
    <p style="font-size:23px; margin-left:25px; text-align: justify;" > The history of chocolate began in Mesoamerica. Fermented beverages made from chocolate date back to 450 BC. The Aztecs believed that cacao seeds were the gift of Quetzalcoatl, the god of wisdom, and the seeds once had so much value that they were used as a form of currency. Originally prepared only as a drink, chocolate was served as a bitter liquid, mixed with spices or corn puree. It was believed to be an aphrodisiac and to give the drinker strength. Today, such drinks are also known as "Chilate" and are made by locals in the South of Mexico. After its arrival to Europe in the sixteenth century, sugar was added to it and it became popular throughout society, first among the ruling classes and then among the common people. In the 20th century, chocolate was considered essential in the rations of United States soldiers during war.</p>

  <div style="width:870px; height: 350px ">  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
    <p style="font-size:23px; margin-left:25px; text-align: justify;" >The history of tea spreads across multiple cultures over the span of thousands of years. Tea drinking began as early as 1500 BC in the Yunnan Province of China. It first became known to western civilization through Portuguese priests and merchants in Lebanon during the 16th century. Drinking tea became popular in Britain during the 17th century. The British introduced tea production, as well as tea consumption, to India, in order to compete with the Chinese monopoly on tea. In one popular Chinese legend, Emperor Shennong was drinking a bowl of just boiled water because of a decree that his subjects must boil water before drinking it.[10] Some time around 2737 BC, a few leaves were blown from a nearby tree into his water, changing the color and taste. The emperor took a sip of the brew and was pleasantly surprised by its flavor and restorative properties. </p>

  <div style="width:870px; height: 350px ">  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  
    <p style="font-size:23px; margin-left:25px; text-align: justify;" >Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, whether in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the practice had spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came into being.Earliest proposed dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000 BCE, when sheep were first domesticated. Since animal skins and inflated internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheese making was discovered accidentally by storing milk in a container made from the stomach of an animal, resulting in the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet from the stomach.There is a legend—with variations—about the discovery of cheese by an Arab trader who used this method of storing milk.</p>

Stinkbugs... YUM! BUGS!  Before Encosternum delegorguei stinkbugs are cooked, their defensive stench is washed away. The bugs can become contaminated, however, with a fungus toxin when kept in reusable grain bags (left); clean ziplock bags are better.</p>

    <p style="width:500px; height: 341px; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;margin-left: 42px;">This unusual soup tastes a little like shrimp, and is made from a mixture of ant eggs and partial embryos from a white ant, in addition to a few baby ants to add a hint of sourness. You may think this unusual dish is made from a strange concoction, but this delicacy is supposedly quite tasty.</p>

    <p style="width:500px; height: 341px; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;margin-left: 42px;">Katsu ika odori-don is a Japanese dish consisting of a fresh squid atop either rice or noodles. Although the squid seems to be momentarily alive, the phenomenon is a result of adding soy sauce, which contains sodium chloride. An increased concentration of sodium ions cause neurons adjacent to muscles in the tentacles to fire (see action potential). Stimulation of the muscles by neurons causes an increase in the calcium concentration in muscle cells which, together with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) left in the cells posthumously, results in muscle contraction that make it seem like the squid is "dancing".

    <p style="width:500px; height: 341px; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;margin-left: 42px;">Hákarl is a national dish of Iceland consisting of a Greenland shark or other sleeper shark which has been cured with a particular fermentation process and hung to dry for four to five months. It has a strong ammonia-rich smell and fishy taste, making hákarl an acquired taste.The meat of the Greenland shark is poisonous when fresh because of its high content of urea and trimethylamine oxide. Properly processed, however, it may be consumed.The traditional method begins with gutting and beheading a shark and placing it in a shallow hole dug in gravelly sand, with the now cleaned cavity resting on a small mound of sand.</p>

While colloquially referred to as the roe (eggs), uni is actually the animal's gonads (which produce the milt or roe). Uni ranges in color from rich gold to light yellow, and has a creamy consistency that some love and is off-putting to others.</p>

They've even been eyed as an option for a protein-rich space food for astronauts. Silkworms are also one of the only two widely domesticated insects (the other is the bee).
In Assam, they are boiled for extracting Silk and the boiled pupae are eaten directly with salt or fried with chilli pepper or herbs as a snack or dish.
In Korea, they are boiled and seasoned to make a popular snack food known as beondegi.
In China, street vendors sell roasted Silkworm pupae.
